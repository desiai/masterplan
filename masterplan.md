### Namaste! Namaskaaram! Vanakkam! Welcome to Desi AI

I envision Desi AI as an independent volunteer driven organisation which focuses on the development of AI tools that can enrich, enhance and promote Indian languages and culture. First and foremost I want to focus on Hindi and its many dialects, my aim is to make young mind more passionate of thier mother tongue and native culture and dedicate thier skill and talent to preserve, promote and enhance that culture through the development of modern AI technologies.

As of the day when I write this, the world around us is rapidly changing, in case of image generation we have models which have reached a stage where we can turn any concept into reality with just a prompt, similarly there has been rapid progress with audio, both in terms of generation and transciption.

This dizzing amount of progress happening in AI, makes you wonder how this could be applied to the world around you, but when you look around you will find that not much is applicable to most of the developing world, as the developing world by its very nature is not dominant on the internet, whereas these model capture thier semantics from the internet. 

This throws a challenge at us, the techies of India, to come together and work together to build technologies, mind you open source technologies, so that one can freely build upon this advances and bridge the gap. If we are able to bridge this gap, we would be able to harness the power of this technology to serve the lowest rungs of our society and make our society more productive and our world more just.

For now this is my manifesto. I will add more details as we bring together more and people and build more tools to serve our people, the desi people.
